;;; .off()
;;; Remove an event handler.
;;;
;;; .off( events [, selector ] [, handler ] )
;;;      events
;;;      Type: String
;;;      One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, or just namespaces,
;;;      such as "click", "keydown.myPlugin", or ".myPlugin".
;;;
;;;      selector
;;;      Type: String
;;;      A selector which should match the one originally passed to .on() when attaching event handlers.
;;;
;;;      handler
;;;      Type: Function( Event eventObject )
;;;      A handler function previously attached for the event(s), or the special value false.
;;;
;;;      events
;;;      Type: PlainObject
;;;      An object where the string keys represent one or more space-separated event types and
;;;      optional namespaces, and the values represent handler functions previously attached for the event(s).
;;;
;;;      selector
;;;      Type: String
;;;      A selector which should match the one originally passed to .on() when attaching event handlers.
;;;
;;;      event
;;;      Type: Event
;;;      A jQuery.Event object.
;;;
;;;      .off()
;;;      This signature does not accept any arguments.
;;;      The .off() method removes event handlers that were attached with .on(). See the discussion of
;;;      delegated and directly bound events on that page for more information. Calling .off() with no
;;;      arguments removes all handlers attached to the elements. Specific event handlers can be removed on
;;;      elements by providing combinations of event names, namespaces, selectors, or handler function names.
;;;      When multiple filtering arguments are given, all of the arguments provided must match for
;;;      the event handler to be removed.
