;;; The .animate() method allows us to create animation effects on any numeric CSS property.
;;; The only required parameter is a plain object of CSS properties. This object is similar to the one
;;; that can be sent to the .css() method, except that the range of properties is more restrictive.
;;;
;;; Animation Properties and Values
;;;
;;; All animated properties should be animated to a single numeric value, except as noted below
;;; most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality
;;; (For example, width, height, or left can be animated but background-color cannot be, unless
;;; the jQuery.Color plugin is used).
;;; Property values are treated as a number of pixels unless otherwise specified.
;;; The units em and % can be specified where applicable.
;;;
;;; In addition to style properties, some non-style properties such as scrollTop and scrollLeft,
;;; as well as custom properties, can be animated.
;;;
;;; Shorthand CSS properties (e.g. font, background, border) are not fully supported. For example,
;;; if you want to animate the rendered border width, at least a border style and border width
;;; other than "auto" must be set in advance. Or, if you want to animate font size, you would
;;; use fontSize or the CSS equivalent 'font-size' rather than simply 'font'.
;;;
;;; In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings 'show', 'hide', and 'toggle'.
;;; These shortcuts allow for custom hiding and showing animations that take into account the display
;;; type of the element. In order to use jQuery's built-in toggle state tracking,
;;; the 'toggle' keyword must be consistently given as the value of the property being animated.
;;;
;;; Animated properties can also be relative. If a value is supplied with a leading += or -= sequence of
;;; characters, then the target value is computed by adding or subtracting the given number
;;; from the current value of the property.
;;;
;;; Note: Unlike shorthand animation methods such as .slideDown() and .fadeIn(), the .animate()
;;;       method does not make hidden elements visible as part of the effect. For example,
;;;       given $( "someElement" ).hide().animate({height: "20px"}, 500), the animation will run,
;;;       but the element will remain hidden.
;;;
;;; Duration
;;;
;;; Durations are given in milliseconds; higher values indicate slower animations, not faster ones.
;;; The default duration is 400 milliseconds. The strings 'fast' and 'slow' can be supplied
;;; to indicate durations of 200 and 600 milliseconds, respectively.
;;;
;;; Callback Functions
;;;
;;; If supplied, the start, step, progress, complete, done, fail, and always callbacks are called
;;; on a per-element basis; this is set to the DOM element being animated. If no elements are in the set,
;;; no callbacks are called. If multiple elements are animated, the callback is executed once
;;; per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole. Use the .promise() method to obtain
;;; a promise to which you can attach callbacks that fire once for an animated set of any size,
;;; including zero elements.
