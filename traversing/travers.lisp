;;; .closest()
;;; For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.

;;; .next()
;;; Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector.

;;; .nextAll()
;;; Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; .nextUntil()
;;; Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object passed.

;;; .parent()
;;; Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; .parents()
;;; Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object.

;;; .prev()
;;; Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the previous sibling only if it matches that selector.

;;; .prevAll()
;;; Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector, in the reverse document order.

;;; .prevUntil()
;;; Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object.

;;; .siblings()
;;; Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.
