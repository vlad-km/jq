;;; .children()
;;; Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.
;;; .children( [selector ] )
;;;            selector           Type: Selector
;;;                               A string containing a selector expression to match elements against.
;;;
;;; Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .children() method allows us to search
;;; through the children of these elements in the DOM tree and construct a new jQuery object from the matching elements.
;;; The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level
;;; down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.)
;;; as well.
;;; Note also that like most jQuery methods, .children() does not return text nodes; to get all children including
;;; text and comment nodes, use .contents().
(export '([q].children))
(defun [q].children (jq) (@call (jq "children")))

;;; .closest()
;;; For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing
;;; up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.

;;; .next()
;;; Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it
;;; retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector.

;;; .nextAll()
;;; Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; .nextUntil()
;;; Get all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery
;;; object passed.

;;; .parent()
;;; Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; .parents()
;;; Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

;;; .parentsUntil()
;;; Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by
;;; the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object.

;;; .prev()
;;; Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it
;;; retrieves the previous sibling only if it matches that selector.

;;; .prevAll()
;;; Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector, in the
;;; reverse document order.

;;; .prevUntil()
;;; Get all preceding siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery
;;; object.

;;; .siblings()
;;; Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.
